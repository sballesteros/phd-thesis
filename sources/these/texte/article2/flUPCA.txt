Human Influenza epidemics in temperate areas are characterised by annrelatively constant phase (despite influenza type
  or subtype alternates) and highly variable amplitude. Influenza
  epidemics peaks variability is currently explained by punctuated
  evolution of influenza main antigen, higher peaks reflecting higher
  antigenic changes.  We seek to determine to what extent gradual
  antigenic drift alone (without perturbations of rare mutations with
  strong antigenic effects) and therefore non-linear dynamics by
  itself can induce Uniform Phase and Chaotic Amplitude (UPCA)
  dynamics. We present a minimal model taking into account key
  processes of influenza epidemiology and evolution. We show that this
  model present UPCA dynamics for a wide range of parameter value
  relevant for influenza A. NO OTHER DETERMINISTIC MODEL CAN DO THIS We then confirm the presence UPCA dynamics
  in real data. Finally, we argue that chaotic dynamics with uniform
  phase should be the baseline scenario to consider when trying to
  interpreter influenza epidemics size variability. 
METAPOPULATION Influenza UPCA
  dynamics therefore sets fundamental limits to the predictability of
  future epidemics sizes in addition to evolutionary contingency.}

Interpandemic human influenza appears annually in most temperate climatic zones of the world with epidemics that peak in the cold winter months. These outbreaks have been documented in the scientific literature in records that extend back to at least 1650 (Potter 2001), making it an exceptional example of a persisting recurrent disease.  Being a respiratory infection, and highly infective at that, influenza spreads from person to person in the form of virus aerosol particles, and has the ability to propagate rapidly through human populations. Average epidemics may have attack rates of the order of 10-20% in cities but in certain susceptible populations (school-children, nursing homes) the levels may reach 40-50% (Cox et al. 2000).  Influenza is thus a source of considerable human morbidity and mortality, reaching some 250,000 to 500,000 deaths per year globally, and clearly exacting a large overall economic toll on society. 

There is still much controversy in identifying the seasonal drivers that generate annual influenza oscillations, and the processes that give rise to their large variability (Finkelman et al. 2007 PLOSone). These are in fact outstanding problems of influenza research today, and are addressed in detail from a modeling perspective here. As is well known from the many studies of childhood infectious diseases, a necessary requirement for the generation of recurrent epidemics is a sufficient and continuous source of new susceptible individuals arising in the population; enough to fuel each new outbreak. In the classical 1977 experiments of \citet{Potter1977} and \citet{Gill1977}, it was established that although hosts infected with influenza gain immunity, ultimately they may become susceptible once again and reinfected due to the rapidly evolving nature of the influenza virus.  Positive selection exerted by the host immune system, leads to a continual antigenic drift of the influenza virus's glycoproteins, particularly the main antigen hemagglutinin (HA), thus allowing the virus to eventually evade the immune system.  The process of antigenic drift thereby creates an important renewed source of susceptible individuals.  Evolutionary forces are thus considered to be of tremendous importance in shaping complex recurrent patterns of infectious diseases \citep{Cobey2008}, and are the reasons why influenza is widely regarded as an invariable disease caused by a variable virus (Potter 2001).  

Recently, new theoretical developments along with recent data, analyzed by phylogenetic and coalescent based approaches (Smith2004, Koelle2006, Wolf 2006, Rambaut 2008) have revealed that the evolution of influenza A H3N2 main antigen (HA) is punctuated with discrete antigenic clusters jumps. Epochal evolution, materialised by sudden change of pathogens either due to mutations or re-assortments can have large epidemiological impacts. Punctuated immune escape therefore offers an intuitive explanation to the time series of Human Influenza epidemics in temperate areas. Within the scope of epochal evolution higher peaks can  reflect higher antigenic changes  )Koelle2006; they claimed this right?),

The recent emphasis on punctuated immune escape has been the source of important discussions with some authors rejecting epochal evolution in favour of a more gradual immune escape pattern \citet{Shih2007,  Suzuki2008}. In this papers we add new arguments to the debate by focusing on the information that can be inferred from influenza incidence time series at the population level.  We seek to contrast ``an extrinsic view" (Cobey 200*) of influenza dynamics where antigenic cluster transitions induce epidemic amplitude variability and higher peaks reflect larger antigenic changes, with "an intrinsic view"  of purely gradual evolution where epidemic size variability can only result from the internal nonlinear dynamics of the system.

Our modeling effort focuses on the dynamics of influenza A, given that of the different influenza types, A contributes most to human disease burden.   We begin by formulating a minimal mathematical that characterizes its dynamics as having Uniform Phase, or regular periodicity in rhythm, together with epidemic peaks having irregular Chaotic Amplitudes; a phenomenon referred to here in short as UPCA.  We confront our modeling results with  time series data and argue that UPCA dynamics should be the baseline scenario to consider when trying to interpret the complex population dynamics of recurrent influenza epidemics.  As seen in Figure *,  long-term influenza timeseries from both France and Israel make evident that the UPCA dynamics are an obvious feature.  To our knowledge, no previous deterministic modeling attempts of single or multi-strain dynamics have been able to reproduce the fundamental characteristics of UPCA which are inherent in many observed influenza timeseries.


\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

\subsection{A minimal model for influenza A}
\label{sec:model}

We consider a minimal model that takes into account three key processes of influenza dynamics in temperate areas: seasonal forcing, external reintroductions and antigenic drift \citep{Nelson2007}.   

The importance of the role of seasonal forcing  has long been acknowledged and is best observed by comparing influenza seasonal patterns along a latitude gradient: the seasonal patterns range from marked seasonal winter activity centred around January in the Northern hemisphere, to uniform circulation throughout the year in the Tropics and again, strong winter epidemics center around July in the Southern hemisphere \citep{Viboud2006}. Climatic triggers appear to be involved \citep{Alonso2007a} and influenza transmission has been reported to be controlled by temperature and relative humidity \citep{Lowen2007}.  However, a precise understanding of what drives seasonal influenza trends has not yet been achieved \citep{Finkelman2007, Lofgren2007}. A further complication may be linked to the fact that although seasonality may appear to dominate, its intensity might not necessarily be strong if there is dynamical resonance as speculated in \citep{Dushoff2004}.

Related to the seasonal patterns of influenza, recent developments made possible through the availability of large genetic data sets, have revealed that global influenza is a source-sink system, with the tropics constantly reseeding the temperate areas \citep{Rambaut2008,  Russell2008}. The antigenic change observed in temperate populations seems to be a secondary effect of strong selection within, and largely unidirectional flow from the source population where sustainable year long transmissibility favour successful antigenic changes. This advance renders migration and influenza re-introduction key processes to consider when one studies the dynamics of influenza across seasons in temperate areas.

As already stated, the punctuated versus gradual nature of antigenic drift is currently highly debated. Previous studies have derived estimates of the rate of antigenic drift. Data from \citet{Potter1977} revealed that the probability of reinfection increases linearly with time since last infection due to an average antigenic drift rate estimated to be1/19.5 years$^{-1}$ \citep{Pease1987}. LEWI: get units  Statistical inference methods as used in \citet{Finkenstaedt2005}, have resulted in estimates of 1/13 years$^{-1}$ with a model accounting only for purely gradual antigenic drift and estimates of 1/23.3 years$^{-1}$ for the gradual component in a  model that allows for punctuated evolution and discrete antigenic change (see also \citet{Xia2005} for a semiparametric approach).

Taking into account these three key processes results in the model of equation~\eqref{eq:sirs} depicted in figure~\ref{fig:sirs} This model only consider purely gradual antigenic drift, in the same way as \citet{Pease1987}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width= 0.3 \linewidth]{graph/sirs.eps}
  \caption{A minimal model for a given subtype of influenza A: $S$ is
    the number of susceptible hosts, $I$ the number of infectious
    hosts and $R$ the number of recovered and temporary immunised
    hosts. $\beta(t)$ is the transmission rate taking into account
    seasonality, $\nu$ the recovery rate, $g$ the antigenic drift rate
    (due to viral evolution) and $\eta$ is the contribution of
    infectious hosts from external regions to the force of infection.}
  \label{fig:sirs}
\end{figure}

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:sirs}
  \frac{dS}{dt} &=-\beta(t) \frac{S}{N} (I+\eta) +g R \\
  \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta(t)  \frac{S}{N} (I+\eta) -\nu I  \notag \\
  \frac{dR}{dt} &= \nu I -g R  \notag 
\end{align}
with $\beta(t)=\beta_0 (1+e \cos(2 \pi t))$.


For this  minimal model of a given subtype of influenza A, the host population is divided into three classes. As is usual, we set  $S$ as
    the number (proportion?) of Susceptible hosts, $I$ the number of infectious hosts and $R$ the number of recovered hosts with temporary immunity. Upon contact with an infected host, susceptibles move to the infected class at a rate that is determined by the parameter $\beta(t)$.  The contact rate $\beta(t)$ also takes into account
    seasonality through annual sinusoidal forcing.    After a period determined by the rate $\nu$, usually several days,  infected hosts recover from influenza and for a period are immune from further infection.  However, due to antigenic drift of the influenza virus which occurs continuously at a rate $g$, the immunity fades  and recovered individuals become susceptible once more, thereby closing the SIRS loop. 
    The constant force of infection term $\eta$ represents the contribution of  infected hosts from external regions.

In order to study the dynamics of the models of eq~\eqref{eq:sirs}
and~\eqref{eq:HB}, we make use of two sets of parameters. One consists of
parameters commonly adopted in  theoretical papers (\textit{e.g.}
\citet{Koelle2006, Ferguson2003, Goekaydin2007}) and the other
consists of more direct estimates of parameters from household studies
(\textit{e.g.}  \citet{Cauchemez2004, Lavenu2004, Ferguson2005}). Both parameter sets 
are listed in Table~\ref{tab:param}.  The remaining parameters
($e$ $g$ and $\eta$) are considered as bifurcation
parameters.
.

The above model may easily be generalized for co-circulating subtypes assuming that subtypes only interact via (Lewi:after? Or via?) a temporary period of full cross-immunity as suggested by \citet{Webster1992}. \citet{Ferguson2003} and \citet{Tria2005} have shown that a temporary period of full cross-immunity is necessary to restrict otherwise increasing strain diversity in multi-strain models allowing for realistic antigenic space in the absence of punctuated evolution. Its inclusion is thus needed in the purely gradual antigenic drift hypothesis.  

Coupling influenza subtype modeled by eq~\eqref{eq:sirs} results in
eq~\eqref{eq:HB} depicted in figure~\ref{fig:2subtypes} in the
two-subtypes case (representing for instance the co-circulation of
H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A subtypes as has been the case since 1977
\citep{Earn2002}).

In this model, the susceptible subpopulation is itself divided into four classes: individuals who are fully susceptible and have no immunity (S0);  susceptible individuals who have complete immunity to subtype 1  (S1);  susceptibles who have complete immunity to subtype 2 (S2);  and susceptibles who are have immunity to both subtypes (S12).   Similar accounting gives equations for infected classes taking into consideration which class of individuals were the infectors. The full equations are given in Appendix, but a schematic outline of the interactions between susceptible classes is given in Fig.1b.




\subsection{UPCA dynamics in influenza epidemics}
\label{sec:res_upca}

As mentioned above, UPCA dynamics is a good candidate to explain influenza incidence time series in the absence of rare mutation and with strong LEWI:  Do we need the word STRONG??  antigenic effects. The uniform phase characterizes the regular annual outbreak, while the chaotic amplitudes of the number of infectives characterizes the irregular amplitude of the epidemics from year to year.
We will shortly show that the simple models outlined above naturally generate UPCA dynamics.

To our knowledge UPCA dynamics was first introduced in theoretical
biology by \citet{Blasius1999} in the context of the tritrophic
vertical Canadian Lynx-hare-vegetation foodweb.
Contrary to ecological foodweb models \citep{Stone2007}, for
epidemiological systems represented by the classical forced $SIR$ model we have found that it is difficult, if not impossible, to locate
parameter regimes in which outbreaks occur regularly each year. For
$SIR$ systems, there are a significant number of years in which major
epidemics do not appear to trigger at all, i.e., they ``skip''
\citep{Stone2007a, Olinky2008}., and this is an intrinsic feature of these models.


In contrast, the $SIRS$ models with immigration
(eq.~\eqref{eq:sirs} and~\eqref{eq:HB}) proves to be good candidates for UPCA
dynamics because of  the higher rate of susceptible renewal provided by antigenic
drift and by the presence of external infections, both of which  precipitate
epidemic ``re-birth'' after large events of susceptible depletion.
Figure 2 display a typical model realization of Eqns.*  and makes clear  the strong annual outbreak, although the intensity of the outbreak is quite different, and in fact chaotic, from year to year.  

It was important to assess whether UPCA dynamics is a commonplace or a pathological feature by scanning the dynamics over a large range of parameter space.  That UPCA dynamics is chaotic, means that it can be detected by checking for a positive first Lyapunov exponent following the algorithm of \citep{Wolf1985}).  Phase regularity was identified by demanding than
95 \% of the inter-peak intervals ranged  between 0.7 and 1.3
years (others measures for phase stability do not significantly alter
the results). To ensure that we do
not select trajectories containing ``skips'', we retained only timeseries having all
maxima with amplitudes that are 5\% higher than the endemic equilibrium
in the absence of seasonal forcing. 

LEWI:  Move this t appendix:   Eq~\eqref{eq:sirs} and~\eqref{eq:HB} have been integrated by a
Runge kutta of order 4-5 with adaptive time step algortihm provided by
the C library GSL \citep{Galassi2003}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \center
    \includegraphics[width= 0.8 \linewidth]{graph/main2.eps}
    \caption{First lyapunov exponent and parameters space where we
      expect UPCA dynamics (black contours). Top : single subtype
      model ; bottom : Two co-circulating subtypes model for an
      average 6 months period of temporary full cross-immunity.
      Parameters: Left: $R_0=5$ ; $1/\nu=8$ days ; $\eta=1.10^{-6}$

      \citep{Lavenu2004}. Supplementary figure in the appendix details
      the periods bifurcations.}
  \label{fig:main2}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:main2} and~\ref{fig:eta_best_fit2} reveals the results
of the bifurcation analysis for both the one subtype and two subtype
models. In all cases, UPCA dynamics occurs in wide areas of realistic
parameters values for influenza. In particular, UPCA dynamics are
possible for antigenic drift values compatible with estimates of
\citet{Finkenstaedt2005} for the model with purely gradual antigenic
drift alone as well as for the model incorporating both gradual and
punctuated antigenic drift.   YOU NEED TO STATE THE ESTIMATES

Figure 3 confirms that the presence of gradual antigenic drift and external infection are key ingredients required to avoid the skips reported by \citet{Stone2007a,
  Olinky2008}. Those skips were found to be present in our analysis for chaotic
regions not pertaining to the UPCA areas.
  

\section{Confirmation from observations}
\label{sec:confirmation}

\subsection{Parameter inference: maximum likelihood via iterated filtering}
\label{sec:inference}

To compare the UPCA model to real data, we implemented a stochastic
version of eq~\eqref{eq:sirs} (adding a dephasing term to the seasonal
forcing function $\beta(t)$) using an Euler-multinomial approximation
to the continuous-time Markov process. We have contrasted the
realisation of the process model ($x_t$) with weekly incidence data
($y_t$).
%
%
We have used weekly incidence rates for Influenza Like
Illness (ILI) of region Ile de France (Paris and its surrounding) from
the french sentinelle network. The data are plotted in figure
\ref{fig:attractor}. The French Sentinelle data are consultations for
ILI in general practice and are publicly available from
\textit{http://websenti.b3e.jussieu.fr/sentiweb/}.  This data set was
selected for comparison purposes given the previous analysis of
\citet{Finkenstaedt2005} and because data from the French Sentinelle
surveillance system are relatively well understood.
%
%
WEIRD!   As the data come per 100 000 hosts and that we are not aware of any
proper way to rescale the data, we have kept the population size fixed
to 100 000 hosts.

Weekly incidence rates for the model prediction was computed as
$x_t=\int_{t-1}^t \nu I(t) dt$ 

OK:  What is t?  Why \nu * I?


and contrasted to the data weekly
reported incidence $y_t$ with an observation process containing a
reporting rate ($\rho$). We let $Y_t | \rho_t,x_t \sim P(\rho_t,x_t)$
where $P$ stands for the Poisson distribution and, to account for
overdispersion we allow variability in the reporting rate by assuming
that $\rho_t \sim \Gamma(\frac{1}{\phi}, \rho \phi)$ (where $\Gamma$
is the gamma distribution).  The observation process is then fully
described by a negative binomial distribution ($NB$): $Y_t | x_t \sim
NB(\mathrm{mean}=\rho x_t, \mathrm{size}=\frac{1}{\phi})$.

Parameter inference was achieved with an implementation of maximum
likelihood via iterated filtering (MIF) as described in
\citet{Ionides2006} and \citet{Breto2009}. 

Not necessary → Our algorithm was written
in C using the standalone math library from R \citep{R2008} for random
number generation and distribution. The source code is available upon
request.

The results of the inference procedure is depicted in
figure~\ref{fig:profile}. 

What are the insets in this figure?  I see. Do they show the second replications?

The transmission and antigenic drift rates
were difficult to estimate and appeared to be strongly correlated.
How does one see this?  From the figure?

This correlation is a cause of concern for studies estimating the
basic reproductive number of influenza based on the first growing
parts of the epidemic curve and therefore neglecting the effect of
antigenic drift (\textit{e.g.} \citet{Chowell2008a}). 

Why is is a cause for concern?  Its not explained why?

Otherwise our
estimate are comparable with previous study with $R_0 <2$ and purely
gradual antigenic drift rates of the order of $\frac{1}{10}$
years$^{-1}$. Our estimates also support low seasonal forcing.

Explain why this is considered low.  What is the variable "rep" in the last figure panel?


\begin{figure}[htb]
  \center
    \includegraphics[width= 0.8 \linewidth]{graph/profile.eps}
    \caption{Likelihood profiles (likelihood value following the
      evolution of a focal parameter, the others parameters being
      re-estimated by MIF) and likelihood slices (likelihood value
      fixing the value of all but the focal parameter at their maximum
      likelihood estimate) (inset). A stochastic version of the single
      subtype model with an observation process following a negative
      binomial distribution is fitted to the ILI french sentinelle
      network data of region ile de France. Two replications are
      plotted and local quadratic regression are used to estimate the
      profile likelihood.}
  \label{fig:profile}
\end{figure}

We then examine to what extent the parameters inferred in
figure~\ref{fig:profile} were compatible with UPCA dynamics.  
Due to
the uncertainty of the antigenic drift rate and the difficulty to
directly insert the external infection parameter from the stochastic
model to the deterministic model of equation~\eqref{eq:sirs} we
considered $g$ and $\eta$ as bifurcation parameters and fixed the
other parameters to their maximum likelihood value.


Immigration stabilizing

Figure~\ref{fig:eta_best_fit2} reveals that the parameter inferred for
ILI data of region Ile de France are within the UPCA area of the
deterministic model for a large range of $g$ and $\eta$ values.

      figure in the appendix details periods bifurcations.}
  \label{fig:eta_best_fit2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Non linear time series analysis}
\label{sec:tisean}

Drop?  Evidence of UPCA dynamics for ILI time series can be found with phase
space representation of the data (\textit{e.g.} \citet{Kantz2003}). We
used analytic signal and the Hilbert transform to access to a
two-dimensional embedding of the attractor.  We also use the method of
delay with an embedding dimension determined by the false nearest
neighbours method as implemented in the tisean package
\citet{Kantz2003}. In case of the method of delay, principal
components analysis was then used to project the reconstructed
attractor on two dimensions. Both methods were found to give similar
results.  Figure~\ref{fig:attractor} presents a phase space
representation of the ILI data from Ile de France as well as
comparisons with two dimensional projection of the strange attractors
of the model of eq~\eqref{eq:sirs} and~\eqref{eq:HB} (two subtype
case).

Figure~\ref{fig:attractor} shows general good agreement between the
theoretical and the reconstructed phase space representation.

\section{Robustness}
\label{sec:robustness}

\subsection{punctuated immune escape}

%demographic stochasticity : effect on noise on limit cycle with dynamical
%resonance: floquet exponent. Few effects.
%effect of noise on chaotic dynamics: few effects.

Due to the growing recognition of the punctuated nature of immune
escape \citep{Cobey2008} it was felt important to check the extent to which UPCA dynamics
are robust to rare mutations with strong STRONG? antigenic effects. For this
purpose, the model eqns.~\eqref{eq:sirs} were generalized so that
at discrete time-steps, 
Lewi:WHEN? Every year?
a proportion $x \in [0,1]$ of recovered hosts lose their immunity and
became susceptible again. 

Not clear????  You need to describe x much better and fig.7b

In order to quantify the magnitude of $x$ we
have used the ratio of the maximum number of infected host in the
presence of rare mutation with strong antigenic effect over the
maximum number of infected host for a typical UPCA trajectory with
purely gradual antigenic drift. 

This ratio is plotted in
figure~\ref{fig:pert}.  Contrasting this ratio to the ILI data,
enabled us to set a maximum boundary to $x$ at 0.1.

Trajectories for different values of $x$ are drawn in
figure~\ref{fig:pert} and reveal that UPCA dynamics is robust to such
perturbation, with any transients being relatively short.  As suggested by
\citep{Koelle2006}, we also note that punctuated immune escape can
induce higher peaks followed by refractory periods. However the
occurrence of such a pattern strongly depends on the time of the
perturbation and is by no ways systematic.

\subsection{Adding realism: Demographic stochasticity, realistic
  infected time distribution, age structure and data driven migration
  scenario}

DELETE→ We have seen that UPCA dynamics critically depends on the existence of
external infections. 
The robustness of the UPCA dynamics was tested by increasing the realism of the model in various ways.   First, we constructed a metapopulation version of the model of eq~\eqref{eq:HB} with realistic inter-city migration routing as based on transportation data flow from 52 cities and shown 
figure~\ref{fig:iata} (data provided by the IATA). Second, more realistic 
infection time distributions were employed by incorporating an  exposed class ($E$) and by using Erlang infectivity
distributions instead of exponential. Third, the population was modeled with three age classes  using \citet{Wallinga2006}
data from social contacts to estimate age-specific transmission
parameters. The full model is written in APPENDIX eq~\eqref{eq:full}:

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

%1-
The studies of \citet{Smith2004, Koelle2006, Wolf2006, Shih2007,
  Suzuki2008} have generated discussion on the exact patterns of
influenza A antigenic evolution, potentially challenging the purely
gradual view expressed by \citet{Pease1987}.  Our results have shown
that ILI time series exhibiting high epidemic peak variability should
not be taken as rigorous evidence of punctuated evolution.  
%
We have illustrated that UPCA dynamics could be expected under both
the purely gradual antigenic evolution as well as for a mixed
scenario where rare mutation with strong antigenic effect result in
punctuated immune escape.  Non-linear dynamics alone can therefore
explains important components of the observed pattern of influenza recurrence and, if
this intrinsic view is correct, care should be taken in considering
that higher epidemic peaks reflects punctually large antigenic
changes.

%2-perspective & inference
The statistical framework used in this paper and developed in
\citep{Ionides2006} and \citet{Breto2009} provides a method  to determine to
what extent a model with variable antigenic drift rate ($g$) is able
to better fit the data. We are currently investigating this direction
with the class of stochastic processes with stochastic rate introduced
in \citet{Breto2009}. 
FIX UP THIS last sentence


Don't understand this sentence:  Stochastic rates allow to access to the
variability of the antigenic drift rate in a full likelihood based
approach thus allowing for model selection.
%
The same framework could also be used to assess the highly debated
existence of hetero subtypic partial cross-immunity for influenza
\citep{Epstein2006}. Partial cross-immunity could have effect on the
dynamics as its inclusion in model a co-circulating dengue serotype in
the absence of seasonal forcing and antigenic drift yield to chaotic
dynamics \citep{Aguiar2007}.

%3-pandemics
In the context of the new animal origin H1N1 pandemics, it is
important to have an adapted, pertinent and tractable model to
describe both the initial conditions at the beginning of the pandemics
(resulting from the co-circulation of H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes since
1977 \citep{Earn2002}) and the competition between the three subtypes.
Such a description is of tremendous interest for predicting the
outcome of the invasion of new influenza subtypes within a realistic
ecological context. We think that our coupled SIRS UPCA models have
the characteristics to be such an adapted and pertinent model for this
task.    How does your model "describe the initial conditions?"

%4- ouverture et generalisation
As a last point, influenza UPCA dynamics could provide an example of
chaotic dynamics in nature setting limits to our ability to predict
future epidemics sizes in addition to evolutionary contingency. It
remains to be seen to what extent UPCA dynamics could be a
characteristic of other diseases. Norovirus whose phylodynamics
appears to be close to influenza \citep{Lopman2008} appears to be a
good candidate for further investigations.

      $\epsilon$ is a small numerical tolerance. Measure 2: period is
      determined by the analysis of Fourier spectra. As the annual
      signature of seasonal forcing is always present, an arbitrary

APPENDIX



As the viral population evolves,
hosts can loose immunity. In the 2 subtypes case g_1 is the antigenic drift
rate of subtype 1 and g_2 the antigenic drift rate of subtype 2. Viral
evolution (antigenic drift) is represented by black arrows in figure 2.

I^k_J\k are the hosts currently infected by subtypes k  resulting from
infections from hosts who were immunized toward strain belonging to the
subset J (which does not contain k).  After recovery,
infectious hosts I^k_J\k  spend an average time 1/q in the classe Q^k_J\k
where they are &#8220;invincible&#8221; due to the temporary period of
full cross-protection and then pass to class S_J where they are
susceptible to every subtype not present in subset J.

Transition from states S_J\k to S_J are represented by red and blue arrows
for subtypes 1 and 2 in figure 2. During the transition hosts pass through
states I^k_J\k and Q^k_J\k as denoted on the arrows.
